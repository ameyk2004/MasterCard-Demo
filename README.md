# NGO - Volunteer management system

```
An NGO is looking to manage its volunteer activities. They want a system where they can track the following:

1. Volunteers who register to help with various projects.
2. Projects that the NGO is working on.
3. Tasks under each project that volunteers can sign up for.
4. Volunteer-Task Assignments where multiple volunteers can sign up for the same task, and each task can have multiple volunteers.
```
