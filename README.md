# NGO - Volunteer management system

```
An NGO is looking to manage its volunteer activities. They want a system where they can track the following:

1.	Volunteers who register to help with various projects.
2.	Projects that the NGO is working on.
3.	Tasks under each project that volunteers can sign up for.
4.	Volunteer-Task Assignments where multiple volunteers can sign up for the same task, and each task can have multiple volunteers.
```
